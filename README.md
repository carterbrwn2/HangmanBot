# HangmanBot
A bot to play Hangman against.

Enter a word and the program outputs the guessed letters until it runs out of lives (starts with 7)
or is able to guess the word. 

Implementation makes guesses strictly off frequency of letters; there is no weight on word popularity. 

Essential files: bot.h, bot.cpp, main.cpp, cmake-build-debug/words.txt
